Welcome to my research site, and thanks for visiting! My name is Nate Jones. I’m currently a postdoc at the [National Socio-Environmental Synthesis Center](https://www.sesync.org/users/njones){:target="\_blank"} and a member of the [Palmer Lab Webiste](https://palmerlab.umd.edu/){:target="\_blank"}. Feel free to look around at my current [research projects](/projects/), [recent publications](/publications/), and my blog[/blog/]. Also, below is some basic information!

**What do you research?** The overarching theme of my work has been to identify management variables to improve downstream water quality, and ultimately, enable the larger scientific and management communities to better address complex problems at interphase of social and environmental systems. This work normally falls into three broad categories: 
1. Hydrologic and biogeochemical processes
2. Ecological Engineering (with a focus on restoration)
3. Watershed Management
More specifically, my recent work has focused on linkages between upland wetlands and downstream hydrology and water quality! [See project page for more info!] 

**What do you call yourself?** This is a hard question! Depending on the audience, I normally tell people I am a hydrologists who works on water quality problems. [See response above!] However, in reality, the problems that I work on require integrating tools [and collaborators] across disciplines like water resources engineering, ecosystems ecology, forestry, and [recently!] the social sciences.

**What tools do you use?** My background is in Biological Systems Engineering, so I normally approach problems through both systems and engineering design lenses. Specific tools include field and remotely sensed data, geospatial analyses, and processes based modeling. 

**You are an engineer, why did you choose to study at SESYNC?** It’s truly amazing what engineering accomplished in the 1800 and 1900’s. From optimizing irrigation in arid climates to controlling flows of large rivers, our profession has profoundly altered the global water cycle. While there are many [and obvious!] benefits to society, there are also unintended consequences for the sustainability of our water resources [and the associated ecosystems] moving forward. If traditional engineering approaches could solve these so-called “wicked” problems, we would have already fixed them! Thus, I came to SESYNC to learn to work with large, interdisciplinary teams to address these large societal problems. [Click here to learn more about SESYNC]. 

**What motivates your work?** I grew up exploring the rivers and streams of the Ozark Mountains and Mississippi River Valley. If you have never been to the Buffalo National River, I highly recommend making the trip! Resources like the Buffalo River are incredibly important to me, and I truly hope my work can help preserve [and maybe enhance!] them for future generations.
