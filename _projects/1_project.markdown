I'm currently part of a large interdisciplinary team exploring hydrology, microbrial ecology, and carbon dynamics of Delmarva Bay Wetlands. The overarching theme of our work is to identify dominant drivers that can be used to  manage, preserve, and restore these unique landscape features. Our larger collaborative group inlcudes scientists from UMD, Virginia Tech, USDA, EPA, USFWS, and TNC.  

My role in this project includes (1) developing and maintinaing a well network accross 6 headwater catchments [50+ wells!], and (2) developing a process-based hydrologic model to explore potential drivers of wetland connectivity.  

Other notable activities from the Palmer Lab include:
1. [Alec Armstrong](https://www.sesync.org/users/aarmstrong) is characterizing sources and drivers of DOM composition. 
2. [Kelly Hondula](https://www.sesync.org/users/khondula) is quantifying spatial and temporal variability in methane flux source areas.
3. [Anna Kottkamp](https://palmerlab.umd.edu/team/) is examining carbon stabililzation mechanisms in mineral-based wetland soils. [Why do restored wetlands not store carbon efficiently?]
4. [Christine Maietta](https://www.sesync.org/users/cprasse) is examining spatial variability in microbrial communities and their potential impact on wetland biogeochemical cycling. 
5. [Graham Stewart](https://palmerlab.umd.edu/team/) is comparing drivers of carbon emmissions accross restored and natural Delmarva Bay wetland.  
6. [Michael Williams](https://www.mdsg.umd.edu/reu/mentors/michael-williams-phd) -- in addition to being the Palmer Lab Manager and maintaing three flux towers -- Michael is using tracer addition experiments to quanitfy wetland hydraulics and residence time distribrutions.
