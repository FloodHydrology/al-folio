I'm working with scientists from the [Smithsonian Environmental Research Center](serc.si.edu) to examine the effects of forest restoration on watershed hydrology and biogeochemistry. This study is part of the larger [BiodiversiTREE experiment](https://serc.si.edu/research/projects/biodiversitree), a long term forest biodiversity experiment in Maryland. 

The two main goals of this work are: 
1. Using long term watershed monitoring data from paired watersheds [40+ years], examine the impact of of reforestation on watershed hydrology and biogeochemistry. 

2. Using high resolution soil moisture data, examine the impact of stand diversity on ecosystem water use. 

Results from this study will (1) guide forest restoration efforts across the US Coastal Plain, and (2) improve understanding of functional diversity and its impact ecosystem water use.
