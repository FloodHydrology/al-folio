Welcome to my research site, and thanks for visiting! My name is Nate Jones. I’m currently a postdoc at the [National Socio-Environmental Synthesis Center](https://www.sesync.org/users/njones){:target="\_blank"} and a member of the [Palmer Lab](https://palmerlab.umd.edu/){:target="\_blank"}. Feel free to look around at my current [research projects](/projects/), [recent publications](/publications/), and my [blog](/blog/). Also, below is some basic information!

**What do you research?** The overarching theme of my work has been to identify management variables to improve downstream water quality, and ultimately, enable the larger scientific and management communities to better address complex problems at interphase of social and environmental systems. This work normally falls into three broad categories: 
1. Hydrologic and biogeochemical processes
2. Ecological engineering (with a focus on restoration)
3. Watershed management

More specifically, my recent work has focused on linkages between upland wetlands and downstream hydrology and water quality! [See project page for more info!] 

**What do you call yourself?** This is a hard question! Depending on the audience, I normally tell people I am a hydrologist who works on water quality problems. However, in reality, the problems that I work on require integrating tools [and collaborators!] across disciplines like water resources engineering, ecosystems ecology, forestry, and the social sciences.

**What tools do you use?** My background is in Biological Systems Engineering, so I normally approach problems through a combination of systems and engineering design perspectives. Specific tools include field and remotely sensed data, geospatial analyses, and processes based modeling. 

**You are an engineer, why did you choose to study at SESYNC?** From optimizing irrigation in arid climates to controlling flows of large rivers, engineering activities have profoundly altered the global hydrologic cycle. While these activities often benefit society, many have resulted in unintended consequences impactful from local to continental scales. In many cases, engineering activities have led to so-called “wicked” problems like aging water infrastructure or climate induced sea level rise. If engineers could solve these societal level problems, we would have already!  Thus, new and innovate approaches are required. *I came to SESYNC to learn how to work in large interdisciplinary teams*, teams that integrate social, biological, and physical sciences with engineering design.

**What motivates your work?** I grew up exploring the rivers and streams of the Ozark Mountains and Mississippi River Valley. If you have never been to the Buffalo National River, I highly recommend making the trip! Resources like the Buffalo River are incredibly important to me, and I truly hope my work can help preserve [and maybe enhance!] them for future generations.
